Beginner Friendly Machine Learning/AI Web
Powerful AI is moving from the cloud to the client, and this is your chance to build with it! Join the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025 to create new web applications or Chrome Extensions using a suite of built-in AI APIs and powerful models, including Gemini Nano. 
Here‚Äôs how you can use our innovative suite of APIs to bring your ideas to life: 
üí≠ Prompt API: generate dynamic user prompts and structured outputs, now with multimodal support for image and audio input. 
üî§ Proofreader API: correct grammar mistakes with ease. 
üìÑ Summarizer API: distill complex information into clear insights.  
üåê Translator API: add multilingual capabilities and translate text into your preferred language. 
‚úèÔ∏è Writer API: Create original and engaging text. 
üñäÔ∏è Rewriter API: Improve content with alternative options. 
These APIs work client-side, which means your AI features are delivered locally, with privacy, offline access, and cost-efficiency benefits. For you and your users, this means:
‚öôÔ∏è Creative freedom: Build freely without having to worry about server costs or quotas, enabling new, proactive AI patterns.
üîí Inherent privacy: Deliver hyper-personalized experiences with the guarantee that user input or context never leaves the device.
‚úÖ Network resilient UX: Create features with consistent availability and performance, including for users who are offline or on unstable connections.
Are you hoping to extend your web application or extension‚Äôs reach to even more users, including those on mobile devices? Implement a hybrid AI strategy with either Firebase AI Logic or the Gemini Developer API.
Ready to get started? To gain access to the latest documentation, stay up-to-date with new APIs, and join the community, be sure to sign up for the Chrome Built-in AI Early Preview Program. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or new to hackathons, this challenge is your opportunity to share your vision to define the future of client-side AI. We want to see how you‚Äôll give the web a brain boost and a creative spark! 
Note: All hackathon projects must be new and original for this year‚Äôs event. If you participated in the 2024 hackathon, you cannot reuse the same project or project concept. Your entry must use a new idea and a new application.
Why join?
Build Your portfolio and skills: Walk away with a brand-new project and hands-on experience with cutting-edge Web AI using Gemini Nano. 
Innovate and be recognized: Showcase your ingenuity and get a chance to have your project featured on Google's social channels.
Connect with experts: Gain valuable feedback and unique insights directly from the Google Chrome team.

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Entry meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Entry reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Contest.
Stage Two: All Entries that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria:
Functionality 
How scalable is the application? How well are the APIs used within the project? Can it be used in other regions, or can it be used by more than one type of audience?
Purpose
Are you solving an existing problem in a compelling manner? Is it an application that would encourage a user to use it more than once for its benefits?
Content
How creative is the application? What‚Äôs the visual quality like?
User Experience
How well executed is the application? Is it easy to use and understand? 
Technical Execution
How well are you showcasing 1 or more of the APIs powered by AI models built into Google Chrome?
Judges will evaluate and attribute a score to each Entry made up of scores based upon the above-listed criteria. The Entries that receive the highest overall scores will be selected as the potential winner(s). In the event of a tie, the Entry that received the higher score from the Judges in the category of ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù will be selected as one of the potential winner(s).  In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Entry that received the next highest total score will be chosen as the potential winner.
Most Valuable Feedback Submission:
Eligible Feedback Submissions will be evaluated based on the completeness, viability, and potential impact of the feedback and written description.
On or about December 5, 2025, the potential winner(s) will be selected and notified by telephone and/or email, at Sponsor‚Äôs discretion. If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within [3] days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein. With respect to notification by telephone, such notification will be deemed given when the potential winner engages in a live conversation with Sponsor or when a message is left on the potential winner‚Äôs voicemail service or answering machine by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within [5] days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein.
